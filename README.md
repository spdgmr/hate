### Hate
// [suckless.org/sucks](https://suckless.org/sucks) ripoff!

List of projects and maybe other random stuff that I hate.

- [Canonical's Snap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(package_manager))
// These packages are often but not always proprietary and because they're universal, they're also slow and bloated. Also if you're on source based distributions like [Gentoo](https://gentoo.org) which I am, you can't *use* the USE flags that Gentoo's package manager Portage offers. And also the 'Snap Store' is proprietary.
- [Red Hat's Flatpak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatpak)
// I guess same goes for this one except it's made by Red Hat rather than Canonical and there's no proprietary 'Flatpak Store'
- [AppImages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppImage)
// And yes, same goes for even this one although I definitely prefer this format over flatpaks and snaps.
- [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/)
// Slow bloated desktop environment that you can't really customize. In fact it might be *the* most bloated desktop environment you can find.
- [KDE Plasma](https://www.kde.org)
// KDE isn't AS bad as GNOme but it's definitely not a good desktop environment. It uses a LOT of resources and comes with terrible default applications like Konsole and Dolphin.
- Systemd
// Systemd is very bloated and it seems like they keep adding features bloating it further. Init systems should be init systems, not a suite of crap.
- Electron
// Electron allows a soydev to turn HTML+CSS+JavaScript into a desktop application. Unfortunately it uses Chromium which means a lot of resources are wasted. In addition to this they do not function without an internet connection.
- Google Chrome
// Terrible spyware browser. Only good thing about Chrome is that it's fast.
- GNU Nano
// Nano isn't terrible but it breaks with tiling window managers so I wanna mention it.
- Nvidia
// Anyone who makes proprietary drivers can go fuck themselves. Although hopefully that changes due to the recent leak.
- JavaScript
// Terrible "programming" language invented by soydevs for soydevs that consumes all your resources and allows you to easily write spyware code.
