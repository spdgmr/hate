### Hate
// [suckless.org/sucks](https://suckless.org/sucks) ripoff!

List of projects and maybe other random stuff that I hate.

- [Canonical's Snap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(package_manager))
// These packages are often but not always proprietary and because they're universal, they're also slow and bloated. Also if you're on source based distributions like [Gentoo](https://gentoo.org) which I am, you can't *use* the USE flags that Gentoo's package manager Portage offers. And also the 'Snap Store' is also proprietary.
- [Red Hat's Flatpak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatpak)
// I guess same goes for this one except it's made by Red Hat rather than Canonical and there's no proprietary 'Flatpak Store'
- [AppImages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppImage)
// And yes, same goes for even this one although I definitely prefer this format over flatpaks and snaps.
- [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/)
// Slow DE.
